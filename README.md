VICO (BETA 1.5)
Real-Time Anomaly Detection and Analytics Platform
Overview
This application is a sophisticated monitoring system designed for industrial conveyor belts, providing real-time detection of operational anomalies, performance metrics, and automated reporting capabilities. It uses computer vision and color detection to identify various operational states and potential issues.

the primary use of this is to detect and monitor SMF1 Conveyance and diligence
